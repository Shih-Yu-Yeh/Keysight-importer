Jira : Software tool that helps teams manage projects, tasks, and workflows. It allows users to create, assign, track, and prioritize work items, as well as collaborate and communicate with team members. Jira also integrates with other tools and platforms to provide a comprehensive solution for project management.

Xray : Xray Test Management is a tool that helps software teams plan, execute, and report on their testing activities. It integrates with Jira and supports various testing methodologies, such as manual, automated, exploratory, and BDD. With Xray Test Management, you can manage your test cases, test plans, test executions, defects, and test reports in one place.

Keysight : A company that provides testing and measurement solutions for various industries, such as electronics, communications, aerospace, and healthcare. Keysight helps its customers design, optimize, and validate their products and systems with high-quality tools and services.
